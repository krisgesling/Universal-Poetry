# Universal Poetry
An experiment in converting any string of text into music.

Uses [Scribbletune](https://github.com/walmik/scribbletune).

Currently just maps alpha characters to chords with a set pattern.
Considering the use of some basic natural language processing to select chord style (major, minor etc), tempo, etc.
